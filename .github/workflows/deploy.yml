# GitHub Pages deployment workflow
# NOTE: This is a temporary hosting solution during development
# Will be replaced with AWS hosting at shredly.me in the future
#
# To revert to non-GitHub-Pages hosting:
# 1. Delete this file
# 2. Delete src/routes/+layout.ts
# 3. Delete static/.nojekyll
# 4. Remove paths.base from svelte.config.js
# 5. Set up AWS/other hosting
