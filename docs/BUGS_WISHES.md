# Under Review

- update round robin to change round robin to be time based. we have 1 minute long warm up phases... for warm up we should probably standardize to select up to 3-5 minutes of exercises. 

- after adding a new exercise with 's' sometimes it's requisite values do not show up eg sets reps weight time. sometimes it does. i have not fully sussed out the pattern but it fails when adding workouts between exercises. 

- some of the exercise category types are still missing fields ex: 
9. [FLEXIBILITY] Seated Spinal Twist
10. [MOBILITY] Lower Body Warm-up
this displays no fields below it but pressing 't' invisibly flips through them. 

- when doing things in minutes we should round to the nearest half minute e.g. these times are super wonky
2. [STRENGTH] Squat to Calf Raise
    Week 1: 3 sets x 4 reps, @ heavy, 5.2 minutes rest
    Week 2: 3 sets x 3 reps, @ heavy, 4.7 minutes rest
    Week 3: 3 sets x 3 reps, @ heavy, 4.2 minutes rest
    Week 4: 3 sets x 3 reps, @ heavy, 3.7 minutes rest
