# Database Improvements

- add weighted pull-ups to exercise db. remove optional weight designation from regular pull-ups.
change dead bugs from mobility to body weight core


# Dev Exp Improvements

organize repo. organize tests.


# CLI Improvements

- introduce swap keys. tap 'a' twice? show highlights around blocks to indicate you are in swap mode. ask user if sure before executing the swap

- tap i to pull up information from exercise description database about a selected exercise in the schedule or exercise database. should work in both edit view and exercise db view.

- allow typing double digits to jump to exercise greater than 9 in edit mode

- stop putting flexibility/mobility exercises in the middle - update to data rules

# Under Review

- toggling mode on 'dumbbell weighted crunches' removes weight component when transitioning to time based work - but both modes still should have weight. check logic on this. take a look at standard strength workouts they correctly transition reps to work time while maintaining intregity of the other fields. avoid code bloat. look for patterns

- tapping 'm' for compound blocks changes from sets to time based but the time unit chagnes from seconds to minutes. it should not change time units when tapping m. in addition, this affects the block level work definition e.g. 4. [EMOM] EMOM: Turkish Get-Up + Dumbbell Chest Press + Kettlebell Swings
   Work Time: Week 1: 6 seconds | Week 2: 7 seconds | Week 3: 8 seconds
even when hovering on one of the accompanying exercises underneath rather than affecting that exercise in question e.g.
  - Kettlebell Swings:
     Reps: Week 1: 8 reps | Week 2: 8 reps | Week 3: <8 reps>
     Weight: Week 1: 70% TM | Week 2: 70% TM | Week 3: 70% TM
it should in fact change the work definition for the sub exercise, if that exercise is what is highlighted. 
- we need a unified definition of how we swap work definitions with 'm'. i want you to investigate the exercise database and provide a concensus solution on how we should operate across weight/no-weight cardio/strength/mobility etc. work definitions. for example we would never show weight definitions for non weight bearing exercises, but are there other edge cases i am not considering?


- add the ability to add emom/amrap/interval/circuit blocks manuall in the add exercise fields by pressing 'b' for block. this will create a sublist (matching the workout template like other blocked exercises) that the user can populate with constituent exercises then they tap 'e' emom 'a' amrap 'c' circuit 'i' interval to specify the type, it starts the title of the block name for them with that, and then they fill in the rest e.g. [EMOM] EMOM: <...> so it matches the standard look/display of blocks of such stature generated by the workout engine.
