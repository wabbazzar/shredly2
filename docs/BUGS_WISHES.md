# Database Improvements

- add weighted pull-ups to exercise db. remove optional weight designation from regular pull-ups.
change dead bugs from mobility to body weight core


# Dev Exp Improvements

organize repo. organize tests.


# CLI Improvements

- introduce swap keys. tap 'a' twice? is there a swa

- tap i to pull up information from exercise description database about a selected exercise in the schedule or exercise database

- emom progressions must round to whole minutes. delta each week should be a whole, even number


# Under Review

- tapping 'm' for compound blocks changes from sets to time based but the time unit chagnes from seconds to minutes. it should not change time units when tapping m. in addition, this affects the block level work definition e.g. 4. [EMOM] EMOM: Turkish Get-Up + Dumbbell Chest Press + Kettlebell Swings
   Work Time: Week 1: 6 seconds | Week 2: 7 seconds | Week 3: 8 seconds
even when hovering on one of the accompanying exercises underneath rather than affecting that exercise in question e.g.
  - Kettlebell Swings:
     Reps: Week 1: 8 reps | Week 2: 8 reps | Week 3: <8 reps>
     Weight: Week 1: 70% TM | Week 2: 70% TM | Week 3: 70% TM
it should in fact change the work definition for the sub exercise, if that exercise is what is highlighted. 
- we need a unified definition of how we swap work definitions with 'm'. i want you to investigate the exercise database and provide a concensus solution on how we should operate across weight/no-weight cardio/strength/mobility etc. work definitions. for example we would never show weight definitions for non weight bearing exercises, but are there other edge cases i am not considering?


- add the ability to add emom/amrap/interval/circuit blocks manuall in the add exercise fields by pressing 'b' for block. this will create a sublist (matching the workout template like other blocked exercises) that the user can populate with constituent exercises then they tap 'e' emom 'a' amrap 'c' circuit 'i' interval to specify the type, it starts the title of the block name for them with that, and then they fill in the rest e.g. [EMOM] EMOM: <...> so it matches the standard look/display of blocks of such stature generated by the workout engine.
