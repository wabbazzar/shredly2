# Under Review

- add the ability to add emom/amrap/interval/circuit blocks manuall in the add exercise fields by pressing 'b' for block. this will create a sublist (matching the workout template like other blocked exercises) that the user can populate with constituent exercises then they tap 'e' emom 'a' amrap 'c' circuit 'i' interval to specify the type, it starts the title of the block name for them with that, and then they fill in the rest e.g. [EMOM] EMOM: <...> so it matches the standard look/display of blocks of such stature generated by the workout engine.
