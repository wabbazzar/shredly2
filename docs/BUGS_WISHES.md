- 'i' pulls up information but we also have a/c/e that pull up amrap/circuit/emom blocks respectively when a compound block is highlighted. add 'n' to cover 'interval'
- 'i' needs to pull up information for compound blocks when they are selected - search in workout generation rules where we define these exercise types with descriptions and display them the same way we display information for exercises when 'i' is tapped
- when only compound blocks are present it is impossible to add a regular exercise because of the action 'r'/'s'/'e' have on the add exercise field (it attributes it to the parent block). I need you to review the hotkeys and make a clean edit suggetsion for how to set this up. im thinking we might have a new hotkey 'd' for 'detatch' that will pop any highlighted exercise from a compound block and pop it out into a separate exercise directly beneath the block
- add push/pull/legs as category filters in the exercise databse modal along side the type categories like strength/cardio
